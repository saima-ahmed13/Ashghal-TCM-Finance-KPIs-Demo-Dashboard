# Ashghal-TCM-Finance-KPIs-Demo-Dashboard


The Ashghal TCM Finance KPIs – Demo Dashboard was created to demonstrate how financial performance metrics can be tracked and visualized in Power BI. The main goals of this dashboard are:
•	To compare Forecast Amounts vs. Actual Amounts across months.
•	To monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Forecast Variance, Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), and Late Payments.
•	To provide decision-makers with a clear, visual overview of trends in financial performance over time.
•	To showcase data storytelling techniques in Power BI using charts, KPIs, and trend lines.
 Key Insights Generated
From the demo data, the following insights were illustrated:
•	Forecast vs Actual Trends: Actual revenue generally aligns with forecasts, with some months showing small positive or negative variances (~±0.5–1%).
•	DSO (Days Sales Outstanding):
o	The goal was set at 40 days, but actual averages hovered around 45–52 days, indicating collections are slower than expected.
o	A rising DSO trend in the later months highlights possible issues with receivables.
•	Late Payments & Avg Days to Pay:
o	Months with an average payment period > 34 days show noticeably higher late payments.
o	When payments are within ≤34 days, late payments drop significantly or remain negligible.
•	Overall Financial Health: The dashboard demonstrates how forecasting accuracy, receivables management, and payment discipline can be monitored simultaneously to identify risks and areas for improvement.
